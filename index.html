                <h1>The Valerie</h1>
                <p>Valerie Lewallen was born on a rainy September morning in 1999 in Asheville, North Carolina, a city tucked into the Blue Ridge Mountains and known for its vibrant arts scene and deep-rooted connection to nature. From the very beginning, Valerie exuded a quiet but unmistakable curiosity. Her mother, an art teacher, and her father, a local beekeeper and part-time guitarist, encouraged her to explore the world both creatively and intellectually.</p>
                <p>As a child, Valerie had a fascination with movement—whether it was dance, travel, or the motion of ideas in conversation. She began ballet at age four and quickly became known for her expressive style and impeccable sense of timing. But dance wasn’t her only passion. She devoured books on astronomy, wrote poems about dreams she could barely remember, and taught herself basic French by watching subtitled films late at night.</p>
                <p>By high school, Valerie had grown into a thoughtful and slightly unconventional teenager. She was often seen carrying a beat-up sketchbook filled with fragments of poems, half-drawn portraits, and lists of places she wanted to visit. Though she wasn’t the loudest voice in the room, she had a magnetic presence—people were drawn to her honesty and the way she truly listened. She was voted "Most Likely to Start a Revolution by Accident."</p>
                <p>Valerie attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where she majored in environmental science with a minor in dance. The contrast between her scientific and artistic interests only seemed to fuel her imagination. During her junior year, she took part in a sustainability project in Madagascar, where she helped local communities build water filtration systems while teaching kids traditional American folk dances. That trip changed her outlook completely: “I stopped believing that life needed to be either/or,” she said. “It could be everything, all at once.”</p>
                <p>After graduating, Valerie didn’t follow a straight path. She worked odd jobs—everything from a bakery assistant to a research assistant in marine biology. She moved frequently, living in Portland, then Reykjavik, then a brief stint in Kyoto, before eventually settling (for now) in Nova Scotia, where she works remotely for an environmental nonprofit and teaches dance on weekends at a local community center.</p>
                <p>Valerie is known by her friends as someone who builds bridges—between people, between ideas, and between the past and future. She continues to write, mostly essays and free verse poetry, and is currently working on a memoir about her experiences traveling through remote parts of the world while grappling with anxiety and self-doubt. She calls it "Forward, Sideways, Backward: A Life in Spirals."</p>
                <p>Though Valerie Lewallen would never call herself remarkable, those who know her would beg to differ. She’s a reminder that growth doesn’t always look like a straight line—and that a quiet spirit can still leave deep footprints.</p>
